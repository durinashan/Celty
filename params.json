The attempt that Celty makes is to make this process dead simple. Celty is mostly self contained, and will work right out of the box.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\nThe only thing you need is a fairly modern C++ compiler (clang >= 3.6 or GCC >= 5.1), CMake for building, and libev for the event loop.\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n**ATTN:** Read [Quick Start](https://github.com/XAMPP/Celty/blob/master/docs/QUICKSTART.md) to get up and running ASAP.\r\n\r\nTo build Celty, create the build directory, and run cmake from that. e.g:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/XAMPP/Celty.git celty\r\n$ mkdir celty-build\r\n$ cd !$\r\ncd celty-build\r\n$ cmake ../celty\r\n$ make && sudo make install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat will build and install celty to your system, if you want to remove it, then you can do the following:\r\n```\r\n$ cd celty-build\r\n$ sudo make uninstall\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the most part the default options will be fine, but if you want to change anything, here is a list of available build options.\r\n\r\n|         Option         |   Default    |          Description               |\r\n|------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------|\r\n| `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` | `/usr/local` | This is the install path for celty |\r\n| `DAEMON_NAME`          | `celty`      | The name of the daemon, it will be used on all the logs and other messages |\r\n| `DEFAULT_LOCKDIR`      | `/var/lock/subsys` | The location of the lock file for the daemonized process |\r\n| `DEFAULT_LOCKFILE`     | `celty.lwk`  | The name of the lock file to use |\r\n| `DEFAULT_MODULEDIR`    | `$(CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX)/lib/celty` | The location where celty looks for modules. |\r\n| `DEFAULT_MODULEEXT`    | `.moe`       | The extension of the module to load. \r\n| `BUILD_MODULES`        | `yes`        | Builds the modules along with Celty.|\r\n| `DEFAULT_RUNAS`        | `celty`     | The user to run the daemon as. |\r\n| `DEFAULT_WORKINGDIR`   | `/`          | The working directory to use when running as a daemon. |\r\n| `CONFIG_DIRECTORY`     | `$(CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX)/etc` | The default directory that Celty will look for configuration files in. |\r\n| `CONFIG_FILE`          | `celty.cfg`   | The default name of the configuration file that Celty will look for. |\r\n| `PID_FILE`             | `/tmp/celty.pid` | The location the Celty daemon writes a PID file for signaling. |\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** The `.` in the extension name is optional, in that case Celty will look for any filed that is suffixed with a matching string.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** The any module following the standard build method in the `[modules](./modules)` directory will automatically be built with the given extension.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** Each module should have a `BUILD_*NAME*_MODULE` that allows you to control each module being built.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** Some modules might have explicit dependencies and will fail to build, check each modules readme for a list of dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Running\r\nTo run Celty, just run the build executable, it should fork of to a headless process as a daemon, or you can prevent it from daemonizing by passing the `--keep-head` option\r\n\r\nOnce Celty has forked off, you still might want to get stats or reload the configuration, this can be done using the `--sig` flag. E.G\r\n```\r\n$ ./celty\r\n[@] Celty daemonized to pid 12345\r\n$ ./celty --sig status\r\n[@] Running\r\n$ ./celty --sig reload\r\n[@] Reloading Configuration\r\n$ ./celty --sig halt\r\n[@] Stopping Celty....\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Configuring\r\nThe configuration is stored in a simple key-value list that allows the simple setting of options and values. For more information on this as well as documentation on all of the settings, see [CONFIGURATION.md](https://github.com/XAMPP/Celty/blob/master/docs/CONFIGURATION.md)\r\n\r\n## Modules\r\nCelty for the most part is all self contained, but if you want to extend this functionality then modules are what you want.\r\n\r\n### For users\r\nModules are libraries that allow to Celty to do more than what comes out of the box.\r\n\r\nIf you want to install a module all you need to do is drop the module in the configured module directory and restart Celty. Or alternatively issue the `--sig reload` command.\r\n\r\n### For module developers\r\nThe module API is documented under [MODULES.md](https://github.com/XAMPP/Celty/blob/master/docs/MODULES.md)\r\n\r\n\r\n![Celty](http://i.imgur.com/oKwH6Ho.gif)\r\n\r\n# License\r\nThis project is licensed under the MIT Open Source License, see [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/XAMPP/Celty/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for details.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
