# Contributing to Celty
If you want to help get Celty off the ground, well help is always wanted, so here is a bit of a documentation on how to best do that.

## Get Involved
The best way to help is to poke around the source and fix bugs or add features, but along with that discussion is an important part. So with that joining the IRC channel `#Celty` on freenode will get you started.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code
Any and all code should be regularly formatted, you can use the provided `.clang-format` file to automatically format your code prior to submission, if you want a general idea, without using clang-format then just take a look at the source that is already there, it should look a bit like that.

### Patches and Pull Requests
Pull requests should be submitted only if all the tests pass and the build works. Along with the pull request, we request that the request comes with a decently detailed explanation of the change, a `fixed a bug` or `did the thing` is not ideal, go for a explanation that is not to terribly verbose. If you changes are accepted, the change will be signed off and merged.

### Module only Contributions
If you wish to have your module be part of the core Celty distribution, raise it as an issue, we will review the module and if it is accepted, we will add it as a git submodule to the modules directory.


## Legal stuff
Seeing as the BitTorrent protocol is often used in unsavory means a lot of the time, it's important to note that the contributors to this project do not endorse illegal downloading of content, or if you do, keep it to yourself, we don't need to know.
